# How do I play blackjack?
The goal of blackjack is to have a total card value as close to or equal to 21 as possible. In order to win, your hand must be greater than the dealer's hand but less than or equal to 21. Getting a value over 21 is a bust and is a loss.
Regular cards have their displayed value. Face cards have a value of 10. (King, Queen, Jack) Aces have a value of 1/11, meaning they can equal 11 or 1 depending on if an 11 would cause the player to bust or get a blackjack.
